      <p>I've been working as a software developer for about 5 years. I have worked mainly as a backend engineer on collections of RESTful APIs, scientific models, and machine learning algorithms. Much of my programming was in the field of agriculture, but I've also worked on a few computer vision applications, as well. I work mainly in Java and Python 3, but I've also been known to use Fortran, JavaScript (no frameworks), Python 2, and C++.</p>
